            Execute the automated daily check-in file operations:
            
            1. Get the current UTC time and determine today's date.
            
            2. Based on the current date, determine the log filename in the format 'YYYYMM-log.csv'. 
               For example, if today is August 2024, the filename should be '202408-log.csv'.
            
            3. Check if this CSV file exists in the repository root:
               - If the file does not exist, create it and write the header row: 'timestamp,event_type'
               - If the file exists, read its current contents to understand the structure
            
            4. Append a new row to the CSV file with:
               - Current UTC timestamp in ISO 8601 format (e.g., '2024-08-04T05:00:15Z')
               - Event type: 'CHECK-IN'
               - Example row: '2024-08-04T05:00:15Z,CHECK-IN'
            
            IMPORTANT: Only perform file operations. Do NOT run any git commands (git add, git commit, git push).
            Just create/update the CSV file with the check-in record.

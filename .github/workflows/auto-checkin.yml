            Execute Claude Code Session reset trigger for Token 1:
            1. Get the current UTC time and determine today's date.
            2. Based on the current date, determine the log filename in the format 'YYYYMM-session-log.csv'. 
               For example, if today is August 2024, the filename should be '202408-session-log.csv'.
            3. Check if this CSV file exists. If not, create it with the header: 'timestamp,event_type,token_id,reset_time_utc8'.
            4. Calculate the expected session reset time (current time + 5 hours, converted to UTC+8).
            5. Append a new row to the CSV file with: current UTC timestamp, 'SESSION-RESET-TRIGGER', 'TOKEN_1', and the expected UTC+8 reset time.
            IMPORTANT: Only perform file operations. Do NOT run any git commands.
